# Settings
The main purpose of Settings is to configure defaults for new Scenes (You cannot set default Audio or Text). 
Some other General Settings exist to help customize your FlipFlip experience. To access the Settings page, click the 
`Settings` icon ( 
<img style="vertical-align: -5px" src="doc_icons/gear.svg" alt="Settings" width="20" height="20"> ) in the Scene Picker
(Home) sidebar.

When you are done making changes to the Settings, click the `OK` button ( <img style="vertical-align: -5px" 
src="doc_icons/ok.svg" alt="OK" width="20" height="20"> ). Settings will only be saved if they are valid.

## Scene Default Option/Effects
Configure default settings for each Scene just like you would in the Scene itself. These preferences will be applied 
whenever you create a new Scene (or Generator). These defaults can also be applied to any existing Scene by clicking the 
"Restore Defaults" button in the Scene's sidebar.

## Player Settings
These settings control various player options.

* `Always On Top` - keep Player on top of other windows
* `Show Menu` - show menu bar while playing
* `Fullscreen` - display player in fullscreen mode
* `Start Immediately` - don't wait for full scene to load, start as soon as first image loads
  * _Be aware this may cause the beginning to be janky, while the sources continue loading_
* `Click to Progress` - enables the ability to advance to the next image in a scene by simply clicking the currently displayed image.
  * `While Playing` - by default, this is only enabled while playback is paused, enable this secondary option to allow 
Click to Progress, even while the scene is playing
* `Show Adv Easing Controls` - enables controls for advanced [easings](effects.md) in effects
* `Show Audio Info` - when enabled, [audio information](audio_tagging#tagging-a-track) will appear during playback when a track changes.
  * _This only ever applies to the first playlist_
* `Clone Grid Videos Directly` - when enabled, cloned grid cells will use a copy of the actual video file, instead of a
canvas. This may improve video framerate, but will remove absolute synchronization.
---
* `Prioritize Performance/Loading`
  * `Prioritize Performance` - This mode will prioritize smooth playback, while taking a longer time to load
  * `Prioritize Loading` - This mode will prioritize loading times, but may cause stuttering during playback.
* `Confirm Scene Deletion` - Disabling this will hide the confirmation dialog when deleting a Scene.
* `Confirm Blacklist` - Disabling this will hide the confirmation dialog when blacklisting a file.
* `Confirm File Deletion` - Disabling this will hide the confirmation dialog when deleting a file.
* `Portable Mode` - Portable Mode will save a copy of your data in the same directory as the FlipFlip executable, 
as well as the default save path. This needs to be enabled on each machine.
  * `Disable Local Saves` - When this is on, FlipFlip will _only_ save its data to the folder with the FlipFlip 
    executable and _will not_ save to the default save path.
---
* `Min Image/Video Size` - the minimum number of pixels each dimension of an image/video must be 
(default: 200 - image's width _and_ height must be larger than 200px).
* `Max in History` - the maximum number of images to keep in history (navigating backwards and forwards). 
* `Max in Memory` - the maximum number of images to queue up for rendering. 
  * Images in memory/history are cleared when the slideshow is stopped.
* `Max Loading at Once` - the number of threads to have loading images.
  * _Be cautious increasing this number as this will increase processing and may degrade performance._
* `Ignored Tags/Types` - add tags/types here to be globally ignored by Scene Generators 
  * This can be overridden by individual generators as needed

## Caching
These settings control the caching abilities of FlipFlip. By default, FlipFlip caches 500MB of images in the 
`appData` directory. However, you can customize the caching dir and max size by changing values here. 
Turning caching off will prevent FlipFlip from reading from or writing to the cache.

## API Keys
These settings control how remote sources are used. 

### Tumblr
By default, Tumblr API keys are provided. However, if you are experiencing 429 responses from Tumblr, you may replace 
these with your own API keys to improve performance. Instructions for getting your own API key are [here](tumblr_api.md). 

In order to import your Tumblr Following, you must first activate FlipFlip with your account. You should only ever 
have to do this once.

Tumblr has no Read-Only mode, so read AND write access are requested. FlipFlip does not store any user information or 
make any changes to your account.

* Click `OK` on the confirmation dialog
* You will be directed to Tumblr.com in your browser
* Click `Allow` to give FlipFlip read permission
